# Assignment 6 - Data Cleaning Recap

This repository contains my work for Assignment 6 in MATH200 at Chadron State College.  
The goal of this assignment is to apply data-cleaning techniques using R.  

## **What This Project Covers**
- Importing and cleaning the dataset.
- Performing transformations and handling missing values.
- Exploring different approaches to complete the "Your Turn" task.
- Possibly creating visualizations for better data insights.
- Documenting findings and pushing changes to GitHub.

All code is stored in `assignment-6.Rmd`.
